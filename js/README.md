An isomorphic JS library for logging data to Braintrust.

### Quickstart

Install the library with npm (or yarn).

```bash
npm install braintrust
```

Then, run a simple experiment with the following code (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with
your Braintrust API key):

```javascript
import * as braintrust from "braintrust";

const experiment = await braintrust.init("NodeTest", {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});
experiment.log({
  inputs: { test: 1 },
  output: "foo",
  expected: "bar",
  scores: {
    n: 0.5,
  },
  metadata: {
    id: 1,
  },
});
console.log(await experiment.summarize());
```
