#
# This workflow is used to publish the JavaScript SDK to npm.
#
# It supports two publishing modes:
#
# 1. REGULAR RELEASE (tag-based, automatic):
#    - Triggered by pushing a tag matching js-sdk-v*.*.*
#    - Validates the tag, builds, and publishes to npm with "latest" tag
#
# 2. PRE-RELEASE (manual, workflow_dispatch):
#    - Manually triggered via GitHub Actions UI
#    - Choose pre-release type (beta/alpha/rc) and version
#    - Publishes with appropriate dist-tag (beta/alpha/next)
#    - Does NOT require updating package.json in the repository
#
