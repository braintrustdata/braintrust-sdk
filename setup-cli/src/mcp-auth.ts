 * 2. Authenticate via Claude Code's built-in MCP flow

ðŸ’¡ This tool is designed to work within Claude Code

If you're seeing this message, it means you're running this tool outside of Claude Code.

For the best experience:

1. Start Claude Code in your project directory:
   claude

2. Run this tool from within Claude Code:
   npx @braintrust/setup

Or simply ask Claude directly:
   "Please set up Braintrust tracing for this codebase using the MCP tools"

Note: If you haven't configured Braintrust MCP in Claude Code yet, Claude will guide you through that setup when you try to use the Braintrust tools.
